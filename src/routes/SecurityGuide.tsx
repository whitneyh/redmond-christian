                <p>
                    The Redmond Christian Church Safety and Security team is a ministry team. Our primary goal is to
                    glorify God and to love people. We serve the church by striving to provide a safe and comfortable
                    environment in which people can worship, be edified by the preaching of God's word and enjoy the
                    fellowship of other members of our church community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This document describes the team's areas of responsibility and the general approach to handling
                    various situations.
                </p>

            <div className="sundays">
                <h1 id="sundays">2 Sundays</h1>
                <p>
                    The Safety and Security team is responsible for the environment on Sunday mornings. Currently,
                    there is no responsibility for meetings on other days of the week.
                </p>
                <h2 id="checklist">2.1 Checklist</h2>
                <p>
                    In order to provide the best possible experience, the security team member who is assigned for a
                    given Sunday should refer to the <a href="/security/checklist">Sunday Morning
                    Checklist</a> document for a list of the basic tasks that should be performed each Sunday.
                </p>
                <h2 id="roles">2.2 Roles</h2>
                <p>
                    Two members of the Safety/Security team will be assigned to serve for each Sunday morning service.
                </p>
                <h3>2.2.1 Lead</h3>
                <p>
                    On a Sunday morning, the lead team member will be responsible for all of the items outlined in this
                    guide and the corresponding checklist. If the lead is in need of assistance, he/she can request help
                    from the backup member.
                </p>
                <h3>2.2.2 Backup</h3>
                <p>
                    The backup member will not have any responsibility on a Sunday morning other than to be
                    available should the lead member need assistance. In case of an emergency, the back member
                    should support the lead. He/she should also lend assistance if requested by the lead.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div className="safety">
                <h1 id="safety"> 3 Safety</h1>
                <p>
                    One of the two core purposes of the team is to ensure that people are safe and feel comfortable
                    when the attend church service on Sunday morning.
                </p>
                <h2 id="people-safety">3.1 People</h2>
                <p>
                    People are the main concern of the safety and security team. Because of this, we want to support
                    the Hospitality team in assisting new people, answering questions and making them feel as welcome as
                    possible. The security team member who is on duty should keep an eye out for ways that he/she can
                    welcome and help people who come to the church.
                </p>
                <h2 id="emergencies">3.2 Emergencies</h2>
                <p>
                    Although we certainly pray there will be no emergencies, we need to be prepared to assist should
                    an emergency situation arise.
                </p>
                <h3>3.2.1 Fire</h3>
                <h4>3.2.1.1 Small Fires</h4>
                <p>
                    The team member on duty should be aware of the location of and be able to use available fire
                    extinguishers. In the case of a small fire that is judged to be manageable, the fire extinguisher
                    can be used to put out the fire.
                </p>
                <h4>3.2.1.2 Larger Fires</h4>
                <p>
                    In the case of a fire that is larger or growing quickly, the security team member should assist
                    in evacuating the church and call 911.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once evacuated, people should be directed to a predetermined assembly spot outside the church so
                    that a head count can be taken to ensure that everyone has safely exited the building. The iPad from
                    the Welcome Desk should be retrieved while exiting the building so that the attendance data on it
                    can be used to perform an accurate head count.
                </p>
                <p>
                    911 should be called as soon as possible so that the fire department will be dispatched. This
                    responsibility can be delegated to a church attender while the security team member assists in
                    evacuating the church building.
                </p>
                <h3>3.2.2 Medical</h3>
                <h4>3.2.2.1 Preparation</h4>
                <p>
                    It is the team's responsibility to ensure the church's first aid kit has proper supplies.
                    Because of this, the team member that is assigned on the first Sunday of each month should check the
                    first aid kit to ensure that it is properly stocked. If it's not, <a
                    href="mailto:secretaryredmondchristian@gmail.com">Lisa Reynolds</a> should be informed so that the
                    proper items can be restocked.
                </p>
                <h4>3.2.2.2 Medical Emergency</h4>
                <p>
                    In the case of a medical emergency, the following process should be followed:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Determine if more than simple first aid is required.</li>
                    <li>Consult with any known medical personnel who are at the church (e.g. Kortnie Shaw or Ben
                        Bernard).
                    </li>
                    <li>Call 911 if necessary.</li>
                    <li>Manage the site until first responders arrive. Keep people back and give whatever help
                        you are able.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>3.2.3 Weather</h3>
                <h4>3.2.3.1 Snow/Ice</h4>
                <p>
                    When there is snow and ice on a Sunday morning, every effort should be made to make the building
                    as safe as possible. Snow should be cleared from the steps of the building before people arrive to
                    reduce the risk of slipping.
                </p>

            <h2 id="people-security">4.1 People</h2>
            <h3>4.1.1. Something Does Not Feel Right</h3>
            <p>
                The team member who is on duty should be aware of people or situations that don't feel right. In
                such a case, the team member should evaluate the situation by talking with the person that seems out of
                the ordinary.
            </p>
            <h3>4.1.2 Anger/Threats</h3>
            <p>
                If a person seems agitated or upset, every effort should be made to de-escalate the situation by
                being kind and helpful. If you can be helpful in a situation, do so; however, if it things appear to be
                turning dangerous, use your best judgement and call 911.
            </p>
            <h3>4.1.3 Violence</h3>
            <p>
                No violence should be allowed. If a person becomes violent, do your best to evacuate people from the
                area with the violent person. Call 911.
            </p>
            <h3>4.1.4 Active Shooter</h3>
            <p>
                An active shooter is obviously a situation that nobody hopes to encounter. If you do, there are
                three choices (in order of preference)
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Run - If it is possible for people to safely evacuate the church, this should be the first
                    choice.
                </li>
                <li>Shelter in Place - If a safe evaluation is not possible, hiding or barricading in the church
                    is the next option until law enforcement can handle the situation.
                </li>
                <li>Fight - If neither running nor sheltering is a viable option, fighting the shooter is the
                    remaining option. Use whatever you have and work as a team to attack the shooter.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2 id="environment">4.2 Environment</h2>
            <h3>4.2.1 Doors</h3>
            <h4>4.2.1.1 Pre-Service</h4>
            <p>
                Before the service begins, all doors should be unlocked.
            </p>
            <h4>4.2.1.2 Once the Service Begins</h4>
            <p>
                Once the service begins, the south door (by the children's classrooms) should be locked. It can
                remain locked for the remainder of the day.
            </p>
            <h4>4.2.1.3 Closing</h4>
            <p>
                When leaving the church ensure that all doors are locked and properly latched. If there are any
                remaining people in the building, inform them that the doors have been locked and that they should
                ensure that the door that they leave from is latched when it closes.
            </p>
            <h3>4.2.2 Situational Awareness</h3>
            <p>
                Most Sunday's will be smooth and without incident; however, the security team member that is on duty
                should always be aware of what is happening within the church. The goal is to solve or de-escalate any
                problem that arises and to respond appropriately to situations that come up.
            </p>

            <h1 id="911">5 Calling 911</h1>
            <p>
                If a situation requires help from police, fire or other emergency services, 911 should be called as
                soon as possible.
            </p>
            <h2 id="911-who">5.1 Who Should Call?</h2>
            <p>
                The security person on duty may call 911 or delegate that responsibility to someone else. It is
                best; however, if only a single person call 911 so that 911 services are not overwhelmed by multiple
                calls.
            </p>
            <h2 id="911-after">5.2 After 911 is Called</h2>
            <p>
                In the case of a medical emergency, someone should be stationed at the door of the church to await
                the arrival of emergency personnel. Once they arrive, that individual should escort them to the location
                of the emergency and return to the door to await more first responders.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the emergency requires the church to be evacuated, people should be directed to doors that are
                not the ones most likely to be used by first responders.
            </p>

            <h1 id="training">6 Training</h1>
            The goal is to provide ongoing training (perhaps once per quarter).
            <h2 id="training-first-aid">6.1 First Aid/CPR</h2>
            <p>
                All members of the safety/security team should obtain training in first aid and CPR. There are a
                variety of ways of receiving such training. The least expensive way to accomplish this is through the
                Bend First Department. They offer CPA and "Stop the Bleed" for free on the first Wednesday of each
                month. Please see their
                <a href="https://www.bendoregon.gov/government/departments/fire-rescue/community-resources-programs/community-training">
                    website
                </a>
                for more information.
            </p>
            <p>
                The American Red Cross also offers CPR and first aid classes. These classes; however, have a cost
                associated with them. Please see their <a href="https://www.redcross.org/take-a-class">website</a> for
                more information.
